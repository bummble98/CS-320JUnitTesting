# CS-320JUnitTesting

Theres a fine line between writing software that will allow the end user as much power as possible to make their experience with your application fit their needs, and allowing the end user full control over a program. One way I like to think of programs is the same way you would want your computer to work. You want your user to be able to create, edit, and delete files. But you wouldnt want them to accidentally delete their bootfiles and brick themselves. At the same time you wouldnt want them to be stuck unable to edit anything at all out of fear they are going to mess something up. When designing software or its tests we should think in the perspecive of its users and be sure to implement code to not only protect the user and program, but to give the user the ability to use the program to suit their needs. Not everyone needs or even wants to be able to change their desktop background, or change the position of their taskbar but having the ability to definitely improves the user experience.
